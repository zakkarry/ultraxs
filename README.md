## This is awesome, can I donate/tip you for this?

Please do. https://tip.ary.dev for my buymeacoffee.

## What is it?

This is ultraxs (ultra.cc cross-seed installation script) based script - you simply set `chmod +x install_xs.sh`
and run the script to install or update your instance of cross-seed.

## How do I use this?

This is a quote from ultra.cc on [their Discord](https://discord.com/channels/427913240316477443/427914848702038026/1320729360700932190) - you should be able to do the same for this branch/version of the script...their scripts they offer just install standard nvm and pyenv at a user-mode level.

> You can now install the latest version of cross-seed by:
>
> -   Installing the latest version of [Node](https://docs.ultra.cc/books/unofficial-language-installers-3AK/page/install-nodejs): `bash <(wget -qO- https://scripts.ultra.cc/util-v2/LanguageInstaller/Node-Installer/main.sh)`
>
> -   Install the latest or v3.10 of [Python](https://docs.ultra.cc/books/unofficial-language-installers-3AK/page/install-python-using-pyenv): `bash <(wget -qO- https://scripts.ultra.cc/util-v2/LanguageInstaller/Python-Installer/main.sh)`
>
> Then, with thanks to the dev from cross-seed, Zakary, who has created a custom script:
>
> -   Install cross seed with `bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zakkarry/ultraxs/refs/heads/latest/install_xs.sh)`

## How do I update?

If you've already installed using this script, simply run it again to update.
When it detects an instance from this script installed, it will check the versions and prompt you to update.
